## 🛡️ Tips for Safer Use

While appleware executor includes anti-detection features, following these best practices minimizes risks:

1. **Use Alt Accounts** - Never execute scripts on your main account initially
2. **Moderate Script Usage** - Avoid running scripts 24/7; take breaks to appear more human-like
3. **Avoid Obvious Exploits** - Scripts that give impossible advantages (teleporting, instant kills) are more likely to trigger bans
4. **Keep Executor Updated** - Always use the latest version from the official github appleware executor repository
5. **Join the Community** - Check appleware executor discord reddit channels for safety updates and warnings
6. **Research Scripts** - Before running any script, verify its source and read community feedback
7. **Disable When Not Needed** - Close the executor when playing normally to reduce detection surface
8. **Read Game-Specific Guidelines** - Some games (like appleware executor blox fruit setups) have specific recommended settings

Remember: No executor can guarantee 100% safety. Users who ask "is appleware executor safe roblox" should understand that all script execution carries inherent risks.
